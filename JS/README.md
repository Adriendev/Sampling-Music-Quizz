## SAMPLING MUSIC BLIND TEST
-----

### About

This is my first project, after two weeks at the Ironhack bootcamp in Paris. In this little game, you will have to find which song sampled the one you are listening to. Indeed, a lot of famous music took inspiration of old music that you may never head before.
